        "- **Dunder methods** (short for \"double underscore methods\") in Python are special methods with names surrounded by double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`). They enable customization of object behavior, such as initialization, string representation, and operator overloading.\n",

        "- `__init__`: Initializes objects (constructor).\n",

        "- **Method overloading** in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number or type). However, Python does not support method overloading directly like some other languages. Instead, it allows you to define a single method, and within that method, you can handle different types or numbers of arguments using default values or conditionals.\n",

        "\n",

        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",

        "# Creating an object\n",
        "person = Person(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using __str__() (called by print())\n",

        "print(repr(person))  # Output: Person(name='Alice', age=25)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "- `__str__()` returns a simpler, user-friendly description of the `Person` object.\n",

        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The `super()` function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class (superclass) in a subclass. It is particularly important in the context of **inheritance**, allowing you to access or override methods from the parent class without explicitly referencing the class name.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Significance of `super()`:\n",
        "1. **Access Parent Class Methods**: It allows the subclass to invoke methods of its parent class, enabling code reuse and maintaining the parent class behavior while extending or modifying it.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Multiple Inheritance**: In the case of multiple inheritance, `super()` helps ensure that the method resolution order (MRO) is followed, and it calls the next method in the inheritance hierarchy, which helps prevent method conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Avoid Hard-Coding Class Names**: By using `super()`, you can refer to the parent class dynamically, making the code more maintainable and extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",

        "    def speak(self):\n",

        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",

        "Animal speaks\n",
        "Dog barks\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "- `super().speak()` calls the `speak()` method from the `Animal` class before executing the `Dog` class's own `speak()` method.\n",
        "- This allows the subclass to extend or modify the behavior of the parent class without having to explicitly call the parent class's method by name.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The `__del__` method in Python is a **destructor** method, which is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or when it is no longer referenced. Its primary purpose is to clean up resources, such as closing files or releasing network connections, before an object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Significance:\n",
        "1. **Resource Cleanup**: `__del__` is often used for freeing resources like closing open files, network connections, or database connections that the object might have acquired during its lifetime.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Automatic Object Cleanup**: It provides a way to ensure that cleanup tasks are performed when the object is deleted or goes out of scope, which can help avoid memory leaks and resource wastage.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Garbage Collection**: The `__del__` method is typically invoked when Python's garbage collector destroys an object. However, it may not be called immediately when the object is no longer in use, and in some cases, it may not be called at all (especially in cyclic references).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class FileHandler:\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important Notes:\n",
        "- **Not guaranteed to be called immediately**: Since `__del__` relies on the garbage collector, it may not be called immediately when an object goes out of scope or is deleted.\n",
        "- **Avoid relying on `__del__` for critical cleanup**: In complex programs, especially those involving cyclic references, the `__del__` method may not be called as expected. It’s better to use context managers (e.g., the `with` statement) for resource management whenever possible.\n",
        "- **Cannot raise exceptions**: If an exception occurs within `__del__`, it is ignored, and the program continues executing.\n",

        "- **Method chaining** in Python is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line. This is possible when each method returns the object itself (`self`), allowing you to call another method on that object.\n",
